# Aseprite-Godot-Theme
It's a skin for Aseprite to make it look like Godot
To use, just...
1. Download this repo as a zip
2. Unzip it into a new folder (probably titled "Godot theme")
3. Copy the folder into Aseprite's extention folder
4. Open Aseprite and go to Edit>Prefrences>Theme
5. Select the new theme
If you cant find the Aseprite's extention folder, open Aseprite and go to Edit>Prefrences>Theme, click default theme and press "Open Folder", finaly just go up one level.
